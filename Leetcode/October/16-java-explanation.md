# Explanation of Generating Pascal's Triangle Row

## Introduction
The provided Java code generates the `rowIndex`-th row of Pascal's Triangle and returns it as an ArrayList of integers. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion for powers of (a + b).

## Initialization
```java
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        ArrayList<Integer> lastLine = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        lastLine.add(1);

        if (rowIndex == 0) return lastLine;
        
        ArrayList<Integer> thisLine = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```

- The code defines a class `Solution` with a function `getRow` that takes an integer `rowIndex` as input.

- It initializes an ArrayList called `lastLine` with a single element, 1, representing the first row of Pascal's Triangle.

- If `rowIndex` is 0, indicating the first row is requested, it returns `lastLine` directly.

- It also initializes an ArrayList called `thisLine` to build the coefficients of the current row.

## Row Generation
```java
        for (int i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (j == 0) {
                    thisLine add(1);
                } else if (j < i) {
                    // Calculate the middle elements as the sum of two elements from the previous row.
                    thisLine.add(lastLine.get(j - 1) + lastLine.get(j));
                } else if (j == i) {
                    thisLine.add(1);
                }
            }
            lastLine = thisLine; // Update lastLine with the current row.
            thisLine = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // Reset thisLine for the next row.
        }
        return lastLine;
    }
}
```

- The code proceeds to calculate the coefficients of the row indicated by `rowIndex`.

- It uses two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the second row (i = 1) to the target row (rowIndex).

- The inner loop iterates through each element in the current row (`i` iterations).

- For each element, it checks its position:
   - If it's the first element (`j == 0`), it sets the element to 1.
   - If it's not the first or last element (`j < i`), it calculates the middle elements as the sum of two elements from the previous row (`lastLine.get(j - 1) + lastLine.get(j)`).

   - If it's the last element (`j == i`), it sets the element to 1.

- After constructing the current row, it updates `lastLine` to hold the coefficients of the current row, and `thisLine` is reset for the next row.

- Finally, the code returns `lastLine`, which represents the `rowIndex`-th row of Pascal's Triangle.

This code efficiently generates the desired row of Pascal's Triangle without constructing the entire triangle, making it a space and time-efficient solution.
