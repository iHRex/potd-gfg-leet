# Explanation of Finding Minimum Time to Complete Tasks with Dependencies

## Introduction
The provided Python code calculates the minimum time required to complete a set of tasks with dependencies, where tasks are represented as a directed graph. The time required to complete each task is given, and tasks may have dependencies on other tasks.

## Function Definitions
```python
class Solution(object):
    def minimumTime(self, n, relations, time):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type relations: List[List[int]]
        :type time: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
```

- The code defines a class `Solution` that contains the `minimumTime` method.
- `n` represents the number of tasks.
- `relations` is a list of pairs representing the dependencies between tasks.
- `time` is a list of integers, where `time[i]` represents the time required to complete task `i`.

## Graph Representation
```python
        adj = [[] for _ in xrange(n)]
        in_degree = [0] * n
        for prev, nxt in relations:
            adj[prev-1].append(nxt-1)
            in_degree[nxt-1] += 1
```

- The code initializes an adjacency list `adj` and an in-degree array `in_degree` to represent the directed graph.
- It iterates through the list of `relations` to create the adjacency list and calculate the in-degrees of each task.
- Each task is represented as a node in the graph, and dependencies are represented as directed edges.

## Topological Sorting
```python
        q = [u for u in xrange(n) if not in_degree[u]]
        dist = [time[u] if not in_degree[u] else 0 for u in xrange(n)]
```

- The code initializes a queue `q` with tasks that have no incoming dependencies (in-degree equals 0).
- It also initializes a list `dist` to store the time required to complete each task. The time for tasks with no incoming dependencies is set to their respective times.

## Updating Distances
```python
        while q:
            new_q = []
            for u in q:
                for v in adj[u]:
                    dist[v] = max(dist[v], dist[u] + time[v])
                    in_degree[v] -= 1
                    if not in_degree[v]:
                        new_q.append(v)
            q = new_q
```

- The code uses a topological sorting approach to traverse the graph and update the completion times.
- While the queue `q` is not empty:
  - It iterates through tasks in the queue.
  - For each task `u` in the queue, it iterates through its dependent tasks `v` (adjacent nodes in the graph).
  - It updates the completion time for task `v` as the maximum of its current time and the time to complete task `u` plus the time required for task `v`.
  - It decreases the in-degree of task `v` since it's considered as processed.
  - If the in-degree of task `v` becomes 0 after processing, it's added to the new queue `new_q` for further processing.
- This process continues until all tasks are processed, and the maximum time in the `dist` list represents the minimum time required to complete all tasks.

## Returning the Result
```python
        return max(dist)
```

- The code returns the maximum time in the `dist` list, which represents the minimum time required to complete all tasks considering dependencies.

This code efficiently calculates the minimum time to complete tasks with dependencies by applying topological sorting to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It ensures that tasks with dependencies are completed in the correct order, and it returns the minimum time required to complete all tasks.
