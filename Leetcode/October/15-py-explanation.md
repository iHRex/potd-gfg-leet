# Explanation of Dynamic Programming Solution for Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After 'n' Steps

## Introduction
The given code is a Python solution to find the number of ways to stay in the same place after taking 'n' steps in a one-dimensional array. The problem is formulated in terms of dynamic programming.

### Problem Statement
You are standing at index 0 in an array of size `arrLen`, and you want to take `steps` steps. You can move to the left, to the right, or stay in the same place after each step. Find the number of different ways you can take `steps` in the array and still stay at index 0.

### Approach
The solution utilizes dynamic programming with a one-dimensional array. It keeps track of the number of ways to reach each position in the array after taking a certain number of steps. The dynamic programming array, `dp`, is used to store these values.

## Code Explanation
Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The `MOD` variable is defined to store a large prime number (10^9 + 7) used to take modulo for preventing integer overflow.

2. The variable `l` is calculated as the minimum of `(1 + steps // 2)` and `arrLen`. This represents the maximum possible position you can reach after `steps` steps. It is important to limit this value to avoid unnecessary calculations.

3. An array `dp` is initialized with `(l+2)` elements, with all elements set to 0. This array will store the number of ways to reach each position after a certain number of steps.

4. The `dp[1]` is initialized with 1 because there is only one way to be at the starting position (index 0) after 0 steps.

5. A while loop iterates until `steps` becomes 0, and it calculates the number of ways to reach each position after one step.

6. Inside the loop, a new array `new_dp` is created to store the updated values for each position after one step.

7. A nested for loop iterates through each position from 1 to `l` (inclusive).

8. For each position `i`, the number of ways to reach that position after one step is calculated as `(dp[i] + dp[i-1] + dp[i+1]) % MOD`. This is because you can either stay in the same place (dp[i]), move one step to the left (dp[i-1]), or move one step to the right (dp[i+1]).

9. After updating all positions, the `dp` array is set to the values in the `new_dp` array, which represents the number of ways after one step.

10. After the while loop, the result is returned as `dp[1]`, which represents the number of ways to stay at the starting position after taking all `steps` steps.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of steps. The nested loop iterates through all positions (1 to `l`) for each step, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where `n` is the maximum possible position you can reach. The `dp` array stores the number of ways for each position, resulting in a linear space complexity.

This code provides an efficient solution to find the number of ways to stay at the starting position after taking a given number of steps in a dynamic programming approach.
