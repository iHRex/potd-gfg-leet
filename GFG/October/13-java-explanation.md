## Problem Statement

The code aims to find the greatest value node in a Binary Search Tree (BST) that is smaller than or equal to a given value 'x'. In a BST, each node has two child nodes: a left child with a smaller value and a right child with a greater value than the parent node.

## Code Explanation

```java
// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    public static int floor(Node root, int x) {
        // Code here
        int ans = -1;  // Initialize ans to -1.
        while (root != null) {  // Iterate through the BST nodes.
            if (root.data == x) {
                return x;  // If the current node's data is equal to 'x', return 'x'.
            } else if (root.data > x) {
                root = root.left;  // If the current node's data is greater than 'x', move to the left child.
            } else {
                ans = root.data;  // Update ans with the current node's data, as it might be a candidate for the floor value.
                root = root.right;  // Move to the right child to explore larger values.
            }
        }
        return ans;  // Return ans, which contains the greatest value in the BST smaller than or equal to 'x'.
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. The `Solution` class contains a `floor` method, which takes two parameters: the root of a BST (`Node root`) and an integer value `x`. It returns an integer, which is the greatest value in the BST that is smaller than or equal to 'x'.

2. Inside the `floor` method, it initializes `ans` to -1. This variable will keep track of the greatest value in the BST that is smaller than or equal to 'x'.

3. The code enters a `while` loop that iterates through the BST nodes as long as the `root` is not `null`.

4. Inside the loop, it checks if the data of the current node (`root.data`) is equal to 'x'. If it is, the function returns 'x' because it has found the exact value in the BST.

5. If the current node's data is greater than 'x', it means that the desired floor value should be in the left subtree. The code moves to the left child (`root = root.left`) to explore smaller values.

6. If the current node's data is less than 'x', it means that the current node could be a candidate for the floor value. It updates `ans` with the current node's data and then moves to the right child (`root = root.right`) to explore larger values.

7. The function continues this process until it reaches a leaf node or until it finds an exact match. At the end, it returns `ans`, which contains the greatest value in the BST smaller than or equal to 'x'.

## Driver Code

The driver code initializes a BST, inserts values into it, and calls the `floor` method for each test case.

The code follows a standard input/output approach. It reads the number of test cases, constructs the BST, and then prints the floor value for each test case.

This explanation provides a detailed breakdown of how the code works to find the floor value in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using Java.
