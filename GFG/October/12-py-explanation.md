# Duplicate subtree in Binary Tree
# Given a binary tree, find out whether it contains a duplicate sub-tree of size two or more, or not.
# Note: Two same leaf nodes are not considered as a subtree as the size of a leaf node is one.
```

This is the introductory part of the code, where it describes the problem statement. The goal is to find duplicate subtrees in a binary tree.

```python
# User function Template for python3
'''
# Node Class:
class Node:
    def _init_(self, val):
        self.data = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
'''
```

This is a Python template for the user-defined functions. It includes the definition of a `Node` class, which is used to create the nodes of the binary tree. Each node has a `data` value, a reference to the left child (`left`), and a reference to the right child (`right`).

```python
class Solution:
    def dupSub(self, root):
        # code here
        def check(node, dic):
            if not node:
                return ""
            s = check(node.left, dic) + str(node.data) + check(node.right, dic)
            dic[s] = dic.get(s, 0) + 1
            return s
        dic = {}
        v = check(root, dic)
        for x in dic:
            if len(x) > 1 and dic[x] > 1:
                return 1
        return 0
```

This is the main solution code. It defines a `Solution` class with a `dupSub` method that takes the root of a binary tree as input and returns 1 if there is a duplicate subtree of size two or more, otherwise it returns 0.

The `check` function is a helper function defined inside `dupSub`. It recursively traverses the binary tree, and for each subtree, it creates a unique string representation `s` based on the values of the nodes in the subtree. This string representation is stored in the `dic` (dictionary) with its frequency. If a string is repeated more than once, it means there's a duplicate subtree.

The code then iterates through the dictionary `dic` and checks if there are any duplicate subtrees of size two or more. If found, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

```python
# Driver Code Starts
# Initial Template for Python 3
# (Code for building the binary tree and testing the solution)
```

This part of the code is for running and testing the solution. It includes the necessary code for building the binary tree based on the input provided and calling the `dupSub` function to check for duplicate subtrees.

```python
# If __name__=="__main__":
t = int(input())
for _ in range(0, t):
    s = input()
    root = buildTree(s)
    ob = Solution()
    print(ob.dupSub(root))
```

Here, the code takes the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it takes input in the form of a serialized representation of the binary tree, builds the tree using the `buildTree` function, and then calls the `dupSub` method from the `Solution` class. Finally, it prints the result, indicating whether there are duplicate subtrees.

That's a summary of how the provided code works to find duplicate subtrees in a binary tree.
