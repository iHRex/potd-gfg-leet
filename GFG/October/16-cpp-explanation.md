# Explanation of Finding the Largest Island in a Grid

## Introduction
The provided C++ code finds the largest island in a grid. An island is a group of connected cells with a value of 1. The code calculates the size of each island and returns the size of the largest island.

## Initialization
```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    int dy[4] = {-1, 0, 0, 1}; // Defines the possible movement directions (up, left, right, down).

    // DFS function to traverse and mark a connected island.
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int& id, int& n)
    {
        grid[i][j] = id;
        int c = 1;
        for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d)
        {
            int x = dx[d] + i;
            int y = dy[d] + j;
            if (x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < n && y < n && grid[x][y] == 1)
                c += dfs(grid, x, y, id, n);
        }
        return c;
    }

    // Main function to find the largest island.
    int largestIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid)
    {
        int n = grid.size();
        int out = 0; // Variable to store the size of the largest island.
        unordered_map<int, int> mp; // Map to store island IDs and their sizes.
        int id = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1)
                {
                    ++id;
                    int c = dfs(grid, i, j, id, n); // Calculate the size of the island.
                    mp[id] = c; // Store the size of the island in the map.
                    out = max(out, c); // Update the largest island size.
                }
            }
        }
```

- The code defines a class `Solution` with member functions to find and calculate the largest island.

- It initializes an array `dy` to represent possible movement directions (up, left, right, down).

- The `dfs` function is a depth-first search that traverses and marks a connected island using recursion. It returns the size of the island.

- The `largestIsland` function is the main function to find the largest island.

- It defines variables and data structures, such as `out` to store the size of the largest island, and an unordered map `mp` to store island IDs and their sizes.

- The variable `id` is used to assign unique IDs to islands.

- The code then iterates through the grid, finds islands (cell value of 1), calculates their size using `dfs`, and stores the size in the map.

- It updates the `out` variable to keep track of the largest island size.

## Handling Water Cells
```cpp
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
            {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) // If the cell is water (value 0).
                {
                    int c = 1;
                    set<int> st;

                    for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d)
                    {
                        int x = dx[d] + i;
                        int y = dy[d] + j;

                        if (x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < n && y < n && grid[x][y] > 1)
                            st.insert(grid[x][y]);
                    }

                    for (auto i : st)
                        c += mp[i];

                    out = max(out, c); // Update the largest island size if necessary.
                }
            }
        }

        return out; // Return the size of the largest island.
    }
};
```

- After calculating the sizes of all islands, the code iterates through the grid again to find water cells (cell value of 0).

- For each water cell, it checks adjacent cells (up, left, right, down) to determine if they are part of any island (cell value greater than 1).

- If an adjacent cell is part of an island, it adds the size of that island to the variable `c`.

- The code uses a set `st` to ensure that each island's size is added only once.

- It updates the `out` variable with the maximum size encountered during this iteration.

- Finally, the code returns the `out` variable, which represents the size of the largest island.

The code efficiently calculates the size of the largest island in a grid while handling both islands and water cells. It uses depth-first search (DFS) for traversal and maintains a map to track island sizes.
