# Explanation of Transitive Closure of a Directed Graph

## Introduction
The provided C++ code is for finding the transitive closure of a directed graph. Transitive closure is a matrix that represents whether there is a path from one vertex to another in a directed graph. It is often used to determine the reachability of nodes in a graph.

## Initialization
```cpp
class Solution{
public:
    vector<vector<int>> transitiveClosure(int N, vector<vector<int>> graph)
    {
        vector<vector<int>> transitive(N, vector<int>(N, 0));

        // Initialize the transitive closure matrix with the same values as the given graph.
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
            {
                transitive[i][j] = graph[i][j];
                // If it's the diagonal element (i == j), set it to 1 (reflexive closure).
                if (i == j)
                {
                    transitive[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
```

- The code defines a class `Solution` with a member function `transitiveClosure` that takes the number of vertices `N` and an adjacency matrix `graph` as input.

- It initializes a 2D vector `transitive` to store the transitive closure matrix. The dimensions of this matrix are NxN, where N is the number of vertices.

- It initializes `transitive` with the same values as the given `graph` to start the calculation. The `graph` represents the direct connections between vertices.

- It also sets the diagonal elements of `transitive` to 1. These are reflexive edges, indicating that each vertex is reachable from itself.

## Transitive Closure Calculation
```cpp
        // Use the transitive closure algorithm to find all reachable vertices.
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
                {
                    if (transitive[i][k] && transitive[k][j])
                    {
                        transitive[i][j] = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return transitive;
    }
};
```

- The code then proceeds to calculate the transitive closure using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. It iterates over all vertices `k`, `i`, and `j` to find all reachable vertices.

- For each combination of `i` and `j`, it checks if there's a path from `i` to `k` (`transitive[i][k]`) and from `k` to `j` (`transitive[k][j]`). If both paths exist, it sets `transitive[i][j]` to 1, indicating that `i` is reachable from `j`.

- After completing the calculation, the code returns the `transitive` matrix, which represents the transitive closure of the directed graph.

## Input and Output
```cpp
int main(){
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int N;
        cin >> N;
        vector<vector<int>> graph(N, vector<int>(N, -1));
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
            for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)
                cin >> graph[i][j];

        Solution ob;
        vector<vector<int>> ans = ob.transitiveClosure(N, graph);
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)
                cout << ans[i][j] << " ";
            cout << "\n";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- The `main` function reads input data that includes the number of test cases, the number of vertices (`N`), and the adjacency matrix of the graph.

- It creates an instance of the `Solution` class (`ob`) and calls the `transitiveClosure` function to compute the transitive closure.

- Finally, it prints the transitive closure matrix for each test case.

The code efficiently calculates the transitive closure of a directed graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and outputs the reachability information between vertices.
